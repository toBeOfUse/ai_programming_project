## Linear Regression program

By Mitch Jacovetty

Run the program with `python regression.py points.csv`. Or, if you want to generate points first, run `python generate_many_points.py 2x+7`; or you can use your own simple linear equation.

The main program displays the input points and the resulting line and then asks you to input an x-value to get a predicted y-value, based on the line.
