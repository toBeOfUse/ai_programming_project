## Neural Network

By Mitch Jacovetty. Written for Python 3.11 with numpy as its only external dependency.

After installing numpy with `pip install numpy --user`, run with `python neural_network.py configuration.json`. Any data deleted from configuration.json will be read from the terminal every time the program runs.

By default, the network is trained on the [Atan2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function, which maps the coordinates (y, x) to the counterclockwise angle between that vector and the positive x-axis.
